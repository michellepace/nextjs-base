## Quick Notes

How Vitest Pieces Work Together

```markdown
1. When you run npm test, Vitest loads vitest.config.ts
2. The config tells Vitest to use jsdom and load `vitest.setup.ts`
3. Your test files can use global test functions and extended matchers
4. The @/* import alias works in tests thanks to `vite-tsconfig-paths`
5. React components are compiled with React Compiler (matching prod)
```

Use Ngrok to Test App From Phone

```markdown
1. Sign up and follow https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/linux
2. Then: (Terminal 1: `npm run dev`) + (Terminal 2: `ngrok http 3000`)
3. Ngork gives a url to connect from phone (shareable)
```
